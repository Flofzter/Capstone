        <h1>Activities!</h1>
        <p>Aka what I consume all my free time doing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="SlightMargin">
        <h2>Art</h2>
        <i>Of the visual type</i>
        <h3>Drawin'</h3>
    <p>
        At the time of writing, I've had the least formal education with this one, as well as minimal stuff learned from the internet. But then this is what I've been doing for the longest.<br>
        I've taken Art Foundations 2 in 9th grade, and that's about it, excluding the stuff that happened before 9th grade.<br>
        Admittedly, I'm quite bad at drawing.

    <div class="SlightMargin">
        <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
        I consider this the passtime I've devoted the most to.<br>
        I do everything from start to finish: writing, recording, producing, mixing, and mastering. I play 2-ish instruments, the keyboard and pads. I would say I play guitar too, but I don' know enough for it to be useful.<br>
        I'm almost completely self taught. Most of what I know comes from experimentation, reading and watching a bunch of tutorials on the internet. The more "formal" classes I've taken I found didn't help me much, except for CE Music Theory. <i>S tier class!</i>
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="SlightMargin">
        <h2>Programmin'</h2>
    <p>
        The one I've got the most formal education in. I've taken 2 semesters of programming, and a semester of Exploring Computer Science. In addition to that, I've had a few unsuccessful ventures past those.<br>
        I'm most comfortable in Java, I can do some Python, HTML and CSS.
        
        I've made a few basic webpages (similar to this one), and a few simple Discord bots.<br>
        The next thing I want to give a good stab at is game development.
