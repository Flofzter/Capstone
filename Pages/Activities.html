            <h2>Art</h2>
            <i>Of the visual type</i>

            <h3>Drawin'</h3>
            <p>
                At the time of writing, I've had the least formal education with this one, as well as minimal stuff
                learned from the internet. But then this is what I've been doing for the longest.<br>
                I've taken Art Foundations 2 in 9th grade, and that's about it, excluding the stuff that happened before
                9th grade.<br>
                Admittedly, I'm quite bad at drawing.
            </p>

            <h3>Stained Glass</h3>
            <p>
                I'm not too sure if I should put this under here, because I currently don't do it. All of my experience
                with stained glass was in school. I originally took a class that's just titled "3D Design", Just based
                off the name, I thought we'd work with CAD or something. Turns out it was an art class, and I have no
                regrets taking it.<br>
                <i>I'll put images up here eventually.</i>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
                I consider this the passtime I've devoted the most to.<br>
                I do everything from start to finish: writing, recording, producing, mixing, and mastering. I play 2-ish
                instruments, the keyboard and pads. I would say I play guitar too, but I don' know enough for it to be
                useful.<br>
                I'm almost completely self taught. Most of what I know comes from experimentation, reading and watching
                a bunch of tutorials on the internet. The more "formal" classes I've taken I found didn't help me much,
                except for CE Music Theory. <i>S tier class!</i>
                <br>
                I'm very into the electronic genre, and that also happens to be the genre I produce. Though I'm looking
                a bit into doing other things, like orchestral and indie or j-rock. <i>And I like those genres too.</i>

            <h2>Programmin'</h2>
            <p>
                The one I've got the most formal education in. I've taken 2 semesters of programming, and a semester of
                Exploring Computer Science. In addition to that, I've had a few unsuccessful ventures past those.<br>
                I'm most comfortable in Java, I can do some Python, HTML and CSS.

                I've made a few basic webpages (similar to this one), and a few simple Discord bots.<br>
                The next thing I want to give a good stab at is game development, I never had made anything that I think is
                worth sharing. I've done a few things in Roblox Studio, a bit on Unity in a programming class, and very
                little in GoDot.
