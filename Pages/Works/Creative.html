        <p>I run a YouTube channel dedicated to uploading my music, just because it's fun.<br>This also happens to be the only public outlet of my creations at the moment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My personal favorite thing I've made so far is SANH4DB, or "Screw Around And Hope 4 Da Best", because that's literally what it is. (And also how I do music.)<br>
            The thing that made this special is that these are some of the first original things I've ever finished. Quite the creative period in my life too. Previously, I've only had stuff that I just killed when it's half baked or remixes.
