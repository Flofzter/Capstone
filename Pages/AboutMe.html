            I consider myself a bit of a madlad. Like I've got this unrealistic "do-it-all" mentality. <i>This is partially why I opted to program the site myself, instead of using website builders.</i>

            I was born in Maoming, China, and after being there, moved over to the United States. Growing up, I've for as long as I can remember had an interest in computers. I also found engineering to be what I wanted to do as a profession, just had no idea of what specific field, admittedly I'm still like that.<br>
